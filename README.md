# KingWeb
This is a website project for a small Minecraft community. The project was started as a .psd sketch:
[![King Webpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomePeaceStudio/KingWeb/master/kingHome.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomePeaceStudio/KingWeb/master/kingHome.jpg)
And further created in Laravel 4, unfortunately time passed and the server collapsed, therefore the project was never finished.
